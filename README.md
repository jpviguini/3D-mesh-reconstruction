# 3D Reconstruction of Human Faces: a Laplacian Approach 
Research project supported by FAPESP from January 2024 to December 2024.

**Developer:** João Pedro Viguini Tolentino Taufner Correa

**Supervisor:** João do Espírito Santo Batista Neto

## About this project [in development]
The reconstruction of meshes from a reduced set of points constitutes the core of this work. The objective is to reconstruct a human face (including the nose, mouth, eyes, and other elements) from a simplified version, such as a caricature represented by simplified curves of the face. This reduced information is referred to as robust features. These features will be extracted from the three-dimensional mesh of a human face and will be used to reconstruct the 3D surface through the Laplacian operator.

## Getting started

- There is a **_python _notebook__** containing each step of the algorithms in this repository: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lm-FyJcLh4ZcomAdfGPfnJpKkfKnvTTL#scrollTo=Q1EQNd8o0u2D

- Make sure to install all the necessary dependencies listed in the **requirements.txt** file.
